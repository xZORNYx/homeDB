## Essential
> HomeDB features a real-time database designed to handle home automation, meteorological, and geographical data. It provides a friendly JS SDK for fetching and storing data, along with a query language and a web interface to represent data graphically. HomeDB, written in C, is particularly suited for time-based data. It is 100% free and open source.

## What is HomeDB
> While searching for ideas to improve my coding skills, I stumbled upon an idea: implementing my own solution for home automation. During my research for a suitable database to store my house's data and allow for a pretty and reliable display, I didn't find an open-source solution close enough to my needs. Therefore, I decided to develop my own real-time home automation database that is 100% open source and expandable through an easy-to-understand and adapted codebase. HomeDB aims to enable you to store and process real-time data for your home or company with the benefits of being free, open source, and secure.

## Why would I use it
> If, like me, you enjoy reinventing the wheel every couple of weeks, HomeDB is made for you. Many programmers want to create their own home automation systems, and HomeDB assists in achieving that with free software. And by "free," I mean freedom, not just free as in money.

## Implementation
> HomeDB will be implemented in C using the Linux socket API to interface between clients sending data to the database. It will also come with a self-hostable web interface that displays data in a visually appealing manner. 😊
